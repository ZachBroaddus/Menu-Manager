Menu-Manager is a custom built, mobile-first, responsive web app that could be used by restaurants or retailers to allow users to browse their menu/inventory, build, and submit an order. It includes add, update and delete privileges for the admin user that would allow the business to quickly make changes to their menu/inventory.

The app was built using Rails and Javascript/jQuery and also makes use of AJAX.

This project is still in development. Upcoming features include:

* more extensive use of jQuery and AJAX to further simplify and improve the user experience

* more extensive testing using Rspec and Capybara

* Continuous integration testing

* Deployment to Heroku
